# Introduction: Recent studies

What is rock? Is it a genre? a style? a conglomeration of genres and subgenres, styles and substyles? Is it a single entity at all? Or is it such a diffuse and subjective category that study of its underlying structure is doomed to failure?

Recent empirical studies of rock (or pop/rock) harmony have touched upon these problematic questions. Referring to their study of a sample of songs from *Rolling Stone* magazine's "500 Greatest Songs of All Times," DeClercq and Temperley (2011) write, "'rock' proves to be a problematic term. . . . It might be argued that what our corpus represents is not a single unified style, but perhaps several styles, each of which may have a more consistent harmonic logic than is reflected by the data we have presented above (this brings to mind Everett's six 'tonal systems')" (50–51). Similarly, John Ashley Burgoyne concludes his (2011) dissertation analyzing a sample of songs from the *Billboard* Hot 100 reiterating the point that "most proportions derived from data are 'over-dispersed'," with the harmonic structure of the McGill Billboard corpus being no exception (188). By "over-dispersed" Burgoyne means that the harmonic structures of individual songs are noticeably different from the average structures of the corpus. This song-by-song uniqueness is not surprising, given the creativity of songwriters, but it problematizes the use of corpus-wide averages as representative measures of the corpus as a whole, let alone the greater population of which the corpus is a sample.

The problematic nature of the terms "rock," "pop," and "pop/rock" likely emerge for a number of reasons. First, these terms are applied to very large repertoires of music by musicians and listeners alike. Hendrik Schreiber (2015) investigated user-generated genre tags in online music services and found that "pop/rock" was applied to as many as 60% of recent popular songs; when separated, "pop" was applied to roughly 7%, "rock" to 39%, and the rock-related terms "metal" and "punk" were applied to another 7% of songs. "Rock" and "pop/rock" seem to be very broad categories, and perhaps ill-defined, or at least diversely defined, among listeners.

Second, there is a disconnect between genre and style that is not always accounted for in empirical musical studies. Allan F. Moore (2001) addresses this distinction in detail. For our purposes, it is most significant to note the *social* component to genre and the *structural* focus of style. When computational theorists study the structure of songs, we cannot assume a shared underlying structure simply because listeners have categorized songs according to the same genre. For example, in an article introducing the Million Song Dataset (2011), Thierry Bertin-Mahieux et al. provide sample genre tags for Britney Spears and Bon Jovi, from The Echo Nest and from Musicbrainz. Bon Jovi is tagged as "Adult Contemporary," "Arena Rock," and "80s" (The Echo Nest); "Hard Rock," "Glam Metal," and "American" (Musicbrainz). Britney Spears is tagged as "Teen Pop," "Soft Rock," and "Female" (The Echo Nest); "Pop," "American," and "Dance" (Musicbrainz). Even without an empirical comparison of the structural properties of these two artists' music, we can see likely social components to these tags that would be difficult to delineate structurally. For example, what makes Britney Spears's music "female," especially considering the fact that a number of her songs were written by men? And why is Bon Jovi's music "hard" rock while Britney Spears's music is "soft" rock? Is there an objective structural feature set that delineates hard from soft in this context, or is there a social, and gendered, component to these genre tags, as is likely with the "female" tag applied to Britney Spears? Further, consider the tags likely contributed by those whose musical preferences differ. We suggest that a fan of country or gospel is more likely to use the word "metal" when describing Bon Jovi than a fan of Judas Priest and Black Sabbath is. At the very least, we cannot rule out the possible subjectivity of these terms without further empirical study.

Whatever the reasons, it is clear that it would be beneficial to study further the possibility of multiple stylistic practices being contained within the broad genre labels of "pop" and "rock," especially when considering these terms over the course of a time period as broad as the *Rolling Stone* and McGill Billboard corpora represent.

However, there is a chicken-and-egg problem here. In order to precisely define "rock" or one of its potential sub-styles empirically, we need to know what songs do and don't belong within the category of "rock." However, as Burgoyne and DeClercq/Temperley show, we *don't* know which songs do and do not belong inside that category. For that we need data from the songs. Which requires knowing which songs. Which requires data from the songs. And so on, ad infinitum.

But there is an empirical tool that can assist us with this problem. Both Burgoyne and DeClercq and Temperley mention the machine-learning technique of *cluster analysis* as a possible tool for discovering the emergent harmonic styles represented in these corpora. K-Means cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm that takes a collection of data points, measures their distance from each other in some predefined space, and attempts to find the tightest clusters of data points: those points (in this case, songs) that are the most near (like) each other, but the most distant from (unlike) the points in other clusters. The measurement for this tightness-of-clusters property is called the *inertia* of the clustering solution. This gives us a tool to crack our chicken-and-egg problem: collect a large dataset of popular songs, define each song as a point in harmonic-practice space, perform a cluster analysis of the corpus in that space, and uncover the clustering solution with the best inertia and the greatest musicological significance. Then we can analyze the songs in each cluster to find what specific harmonic practices are contained within the larger corpus, whose properties have been averaged over by the corpus-wide analysis.

We (the instructor and students in a vertically integrated, interdisciplinary course on computational music analysis at the University of Colorado–Boulder) performed just such an analysis on the songs in the McGill Billboard Dataset (Version 2.0). As the following results demonstrate, there does seem to be multiple distinct harmonic (sub-)grammars present in the McGill Billboard corpus, and these (sub-)grammars bear significant similarity to the "tonal systems" proposed by Walter Everett (2004) as well as to a number of proposed pop/rock harmonic schemata (many of which are listed on [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony)).
